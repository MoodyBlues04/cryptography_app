<h1>AES in CBC Mode: Demystified</h1>

<p>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a powerful symmetric encryption algorithm used to protect sensitive data. But
    AES itself is a *block cipher*, meaning it encrypts data in fixed-size chunks called blocks. To encrypt longer
    messages, we need a *mode of operation*. One of the most common and secure modes is CBC (Cipher Block Chaining).</p>

<h2>What is CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)?</h2>

<p>CBC mode introduces a crucial element for security: an <span class="important">Initialization Vector (IV)</span>.
    Think of the IV as a random starting point for the encryption process. It makes sure that even if you encrypt the
    same plaintext multiple times with the same key, you'll get different ciphertexts each time. This prevents attackers
    from recognizing patterns.</p>

<h2>How CBC Mode Works: Step-by-Step</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Initialization Vector (IV):</span> Choose a random, unique IV for each encryption.
            <span class="important">Never reuse an IV with the same key!</span> The IV is *not* a secret; it's
            transmitted along with the ciphertext.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Padding:</span> AES works on fixed-size blocks. If your message isn't a multiple of
            the AES block size (usually 16 bytes for AES-128), you need to <span class="important">pad</span> it.
            Padding adds extra bytes to the end of the message to make it the right length. A common padding scheme is
            PKCS7.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">XOR with IV (First Block):</span> The first block of your padded plaintext is XORed
            (exclusive OR) with the IV.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">AES Encryption:</span> The result of the XOR operation is then encrypted using the
            AES algorithm with your secret key.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Chaining:</span> The ciphertext output from the previous step is now XORed with the
            *next* block of plaintext. This "chaining" is what gives CBC its name and its increased security. This is
            the core idea of CBC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Repeat:</span> Steps 4 and 5 are repeated for all remaining blocks of plaintext.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Ciphertext Output:</span> The final ciphertext is the concatenation of the IV
            followed by all the encrypted blocks.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Decryption in CBC Mode</h2>

<p>Decryption is the reverse process, but it's just as important to understand:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Extract IV:</span> Separate the IV from the beginning of the ciphertext.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Decrypt the First Block:</span> Decrypt the first ciphertext block using AES and your
            key.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">XOR with IV:</span> XOR the result of the AES decryption with the IV. This gives you
            the first plaintext block.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Decrypt Subsequent Blocks:</span> For each subsequent ciphertext block: decrypt it
            using AES, then XOR the result with the *previous* ciphertext block (not the previous plaintext block!).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Unpadding:</span> After decrypting all blocks, remove the padding to get the original
            message.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Why is CBC Mode More Secure?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Prevents Pattern Recognition:</span> The IV and the chaining mechanism ensure that
            even identical plaintext blocks will encrypt to different ciphertext blocks, preventing attackers from
            detecting patterns and potentially breaking the encryption.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Diffusion:</span> A change in one plaintext block affects all subsequent ciphertext
            blocks. This makes it harder for attackers to manipulate the message without detection.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Considerations:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Key Management:</span> Securely storing and managing your AES key is paramount. If
            the key is compromised, the encryption is worthless.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">IV Generation:</span> The IV must be truly random and unique for each encryption.
            Using a predictable or reused IV severely weakens the encryption.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><span class="important">Padding Oracle Attacks:</span> Be aware of padding oracle attacks, which can
            potentially allow attackers to decrypt messages if they can observe how the decryption process handles
            invalid padding. Use a secure implementation of CBC with proper error handling to mitigate these attacks.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let's say our plaintext is "HELLO" and we need to encrypt it with AES-128 (16-byte block size). We'll pad it to be 16
    bytes, generate a random IV, and use a secret key.</p>

<p> (Example is simplified for explanation, actual AES operations are much more complex). </p>

<p>While providing the *exact* AES implementation is beyond the scope of this explanation (it involves complex
    mathematical operations and lookup tables), this HTML page gives you a solid understanding of the CBC mode of
    operation. If you're interested in implementing AES from scratch, I'd recommend consulting the official AES
    specification (FIPS PUB 197) and cryptographic textbooks.</p>

Responsive Image: The CSS now includes max-width: 100% for images, making them responsive to different screen sizes.
Long Line Handling: Added overflow-x: auto to the .code style to allow horizontal scrolling for long code lines.
This HTML provides a solid educational resource on AES in CBC mode, suitable for someone without a deep background in cryptography. Remember that implementing AES correctly from scratch is very difficult and prone to errors. It is strongly recommended to use well-vetted cryptographic libraries in real-world applications.
